        content: `**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

**Key benefits:**
- **Reduces complexity**: Focus on what an object does, not how it does it
- **Increases modularity**: Changes to implementation don't affect users
- **Improves maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend code
- **Enables polymorphism**: Different implementations of the same interface

**Two types of abstraction:**
1. **Data abstraction**: Hiding internal data representation
2. **Control abstraction**: Hiding implementation details of operations

**Real-world example**: When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift without knowing how the engine, transmission, or brakes work internally.`,
