**Real-world analogy**: Think of a chef in a restaurant. A chef's responsibility is to cook food. They shouldn't also be responsible for taking orders, cleaning tables, or managing finances. Each person has one clear responsibility.

**How to identify SRP violations:**
- Look for classes with multiple reasons to change
- Check for classes doing multiple unrelated tasks
- Watch for classes with many public methods serving different purposes
- Notice if class names contain "and" or "or" (like "UserAndPayment")

**Best Practices:**
- Keep classes small and focused
- Use descriptive names that reflect the single responsibility
- If you can't describe a class purpose in one sentence, it might be doing too much
