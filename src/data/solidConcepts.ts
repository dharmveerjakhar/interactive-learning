        content: `The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** states that:
1. **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules**. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. **Abstractions should not depend on details**. Details should depend on abstractions.

**What does this mean?**
- **High-level modules**: Classes that implement business logic
- **Low-level modules**: Classes that handle specific details (database, file system, external APIs)
- **Abstractions**: Interfaces or abstract classes that define contracts

**Why is this important?**
- **Loose coupling**: Changes in implementation details don't affect business logic
- **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies for testing
- **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations without changing high-level code

**Real-world analogy**: A light switch (high-level) doesn't need to know about the specific wiring or bulb type (low-level). It just knows there's an interface to turn lights on/off.`,
